# PowerBI Portfolio Projects

Hi, I’m Lily – welcome to my Power BI Project Portfolio!

Creating this portfolio has been an exciting journey, allowing me to gain hands-on experience and demonstrate my skills in data analytics and visualization. Throughout this process, I’ve progressed from building simple visualizations to performing data cleaning, transformation, and modeling. I've also developed interactive dashboards and applied advanced DAX functions to deliver deeper insights.

This portfolio reflects not just my technical growth, but also my analytical thinking and problem-solving approach in turning raw data into impactful business intelligence.

## HR Attrition Analysis

The HR Analytics project was a great opportunity to showcase my data visualization and formatting skills, focusing on clear, impactful visuals that highlight key HR metrics and trends.

## Video Game Sales

In the Video Game Sales Dashboard project, I focused on enhancing user interactivity by incorporating slicers and button navigators for seamless page-to-page navigation. This approach improved user experience and allowed for intuitive exploration of sales trends across different platforms, genres, and time periods.

## Car Sales Insights

This project gave me the opportunity to dive deeper into advanced DAX functions, enabling the creation of Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Growth visuals. I also implemented dynamic conditional formatting to highlight performance based on growth rates.
